    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This site is a solo project that is used to evaluate my HTML/CSS knowledge at the end of a course. The techniques I've used are Flexbox, Grid, SCSS, Transitions and Media Queries.
        The general idea behind this site was helpful guides and articles for people interested in improving themselves.
    </p>
    <p>The theme style was inspired by the Heroes of the Storm user interface.

    <h3>The Future of this project</h3>
    <p>
        This is far from the last draft of this project, as I made so many mistakes during the development process. I've structured the code incredibly poorly and I will make more and more projects to practice avoiding these terrible mistakes.
