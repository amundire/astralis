&lt;h1 class=&quot;post-header&quot;&gt;Cursed Hollow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-intro&quot;&gt;If you're familiar with any of the other big MOBAs, Cursed Hollow is about as familiar ground as it gets. The three-lane map pays tribute to tradition, but there's a different kind of tribute at play as well. Throughout the match, the map's Raven Lord overseer will announce the spawning of a special Tribute, one that can turn the tide of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Tributes work on Cursed Hollow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first team to collect a total of three of these trinkets will have a Curse placed against their opponents. This reduces enemy minion health to one, prevents defensive forts from firing, and those forts will also only have 50% of their structural health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the team that fails to reach three Tributes first will still hold onto those they've managed to collect, making it more likely they'll trigger this special effect the next time around. The other team will have to hunt down another three first if they're to beat them once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to win more games on Cursed Hollow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've played much Heroes of the Storm at all, you'll know that the way to win matches lies in working towards the special objectives of each map - and this has never been truer than on Cursed Hollow. If you can land the Curse on your opposing team a couple of times in a match, you're well on your way to getting over the finishing line first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few popular tactics that can increase your win-rate on the map. Some teams like to apply pressure on all three lanes, then make one big united push towards the enemy base, forcing the opposing team to defend while a spare player grabs the Tribute. If you're working well together, this can be a powerful - if slightly risky - play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can play things a little more defensively, make sure that the enemy threat is held back at all times, and above all else not die! Once a Tribute spawns, the team then collectively moves as one towards the location of the item, brawling against any roaming enemy packs in one dedicated fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Using Mercenary Camps on Cursed Hollow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're at an appropriate level, and capturing them is easy enough, consider taking down a Mercenary Camp immediately before picking up your final Tribute. If those wandering packs of mighty minions can get to Cursed fortifications, they'll make very light work of ripping through the enemy team's defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cursed Hollow tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- If your team becomes Cursed, keep communication up at all times and check your minimap constantly for signs of a large push. Assemble your team and go and do whatever it takes to hold back the invading force, and defend your defences!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- If you've been fortunate/skilful enough to ensure that your team has Cursed the enemy, join up as one and charge towards the other side of the map. Don't worry about picking off any enemy Heroes along the way, as your main priority should be to obliterate the forts while they're severely weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- While Blizzard has done a pretty good job of providing plenty of catch-up mechanisms in Heroes of the Storm, there's no denying the fact that the team that lands the first Curse typically maintains the advantage throughout the remainder of the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Never assume that the other players understand the importance of gathering Tributes. A few quick, friendly lines tapped out in chat while you're preparing for battle can make all the difference. People will take guidance if you give it in good spirit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-header&quot;&gt;Cosmic Anomaly Card Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mage is getting some solid Spell Damage minions and synergies this expansion, and I like it. This card seems pretty powerful, but only in the right deck. You could say that technically since Evolved Kobold has seen play, this also might. But that was when Emperor Thaurissan was in play, and Kobold would be just as strong as this one in Freeze Mage, since it’s the Spell Damage part you cared about anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the body, however, this might see play in regular decks, unlike a 2/2 Kobold. 4/3 for 4 is still not great, but it’s a 3 mana worth of stats for 4 mana, not a ~1.5 mana of stats for 4 mana. 3 health is harder to take down than 2, and 4 attack means that it can pack some punch if it survives. It’s about as good as it can get on a +2 Spell Damage minion… Spell Damage is a pretty expensive mechanic. Like, remember cards like Spellweaver or Darkmire Moonkin? They’re way, way more severely under-statted than this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for where it might be useful. Tempo Mage is the first candidate. The deck’s 4 mana slot is awkward right now, with Lifedrinker, which honestly isn’t the best card. Is this better? Hard to say. Right now I’d say they’re similar. On the one hand, Lifedrinker is guaranteed to deal 3 and heal for 3. This one isn’t, but as soon as you combo it with at least 2 spells, it deals more damage. Plus it has a better body. Not to mention that the spells can be used for board control – like 5 damage Frostbolt to clear some Taunt and keep your minions alive. That said, I feel like the deck would really need another cheap damage spell before really taking advantage of this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deck I could see this most useful in some kind of Spell Damage. A deck that specifically runs Spell Damage minions along cheap spells to make them much stronger. Just to give you an example – the new Shooting Star spell is perfect for this kind of build. 1 damage to 3 minions for 1 mana is okay, but 3 damage to 3 minions for 1 mana is bonkers. Same goes with something like a simple Arcane Explosion – it’s 3 AoE damage with +2 Spell Damage. Those kind of spells benefit most from Spell Damage. Too bad Arcane Blast is not in Standard, because it would be amazing with this card too. That’s the main problem I see – not enough cheap, damage spells. But we still have a few cards left to be revealed, so there is still some chance that we’ll get another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the card definitely has lots of potential. It’s +2 Spell Damage on a solid body, with an Elemental tag. It will see play sooner or later. Might not be now, because it feels too slow for the Burn Mage, and the Spell Damage build is not fleshed out enough yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card rating: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;post-header&quot;&gt;Algalon the Observer - Tactics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phase 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algalon transforms the arena into space and immediately begins attacking the player with the highest threat. Algalon hits very hard and fast; he casts Quantum Strike on the tank with high frequency, so healers must ensure that the tank remains at full health at all times. All DPS merely attack the boss the best they can. Algalon can be positioned anywhere, as he has no frontal cleave or cone attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 15 seconds, Algalon begins casting Phase Punch on the current tank every 15 seconds and also summons four Collapsing Stars. Once the tank gets 5 stacks of the Phase Punch debuff, that tank is ported out for 10 seconds as if he stepped into a Black Hole, whereupon the debuff is completely removed. Algalon then switches to the second highest on his threat table. Your off-tank should be ready to taunt, with healers ready to change targets, as the off-tank begins taking substantial damage very quickly. Algalon will be Phase Punching the tanks throughout the fight; tanks must keep switching after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assign one or two ranged DPS to kill the Collapsing Stars one at a time. Since they slowly lose health on their own (1% health per second), if left alone, they will all explode at the same time and wipe the raid. Alert the healers so they are ready before a Collapsing Star is killed, as the entire raid takes roughly 16,000 shadow damage regardless of positioning (a tank who is too low on health when a star explodes can die and likely cause a wipe). When a star dies, it leaves behind a Black Hole, which is both a void zone and a portal to another realm. Collapsing Stars keep spawning throughout the fight until Phase 2 and should always be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every 25 seconds, Algalon casts Cosmic Smash on a random player, including a tank. This appears as a red fissure, which explodes after a few seconds. Everyone—not just the targeted player—should move away from the red fissure, as it causes splash Fire damage, based on player distance with the impact point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: On 25-man, Algalon casts three separate Cosmic Smashes on three random players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty seconds after the initial pull, Algalon summons three Living Constellations that cast Arcane Barrage on random players and have normal threat tables. It is unnecessary to DPS a Living Constellation. Instead, a single player can aggro these and run behind any available Black Hole, as any Living Constellation that passes through a Black Hole dies instantly, causing that Black Hole to disappear. The player assigned to do this should be careful to run around a Black Hole instead of through it to avoid being portaled. Death Knights are an ideal choice for this, as they can stand behind Black Holes and use Death Grip to pull the Constellations into the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every 90 seconds from the initial pull, Algalon begins casting an 8-second lethal spell called Big Bang. To avoid getting hit by Big Bang, everyone must enter a Black Hole created by a killed Collapsing Star except for one person. For this reason, all players should be aware of the location of remaining Black Holes after Living Constellations are killed. Players need not enter the same Black Hole as everyone else; all Black Holes lead to the same dark realm. Once inside the Black Hole, players take roughly 1,500 Shadow damage per second and must avoid elite adds called Dark Matter scattered throughout the realm until Algalon finishes casting Big Bang, and automatically portals everyone back to the normal realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everyone enters the Black Holes and Algalon has no player in the normal realm to target, he kills the raid with Ascend to the Heavens, then resets. For this reason, one player must remain in the normal realm to eat the Big Bang. A player protected with a Holy Priest's [Guardian Spirit], a Shadow Priest casting [Dispersion], a Fire Mage with [Cauterize], or a tank blowing all cooldowns are all capable of eating the Big Bang. Note: Big Bang ignores immunity effects such as Hand of Protection, Ice Block, and Divine Shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering a Black Hole also resets all threat of the player. If the currently Phase Punched tank stays outside to eat the Big Bang, the off-tank can taunt to gain all the threat he had upon return to the normal realm, ensuring that the rest of the raid doesn't pull aggro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase continues until Algalon reaches 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phase 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Algalon reaches 20%, Collapsing Stars and Living Constellations despawn and stop respawning, and all open Black Holes disappear. Algalon continues to cast Quantum Strike, Phase Punch, Cosmic Smash, and Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algalon then summons four new Black Holes in a square pattern. Every 30 seconds, four Unleashed Dark Matters will spawn, one from each Black Hole. The off-tank needs to pick these up and tank them to the side for the rest of the fight, and DPS must burn down Algalon before these adds pile up and become too much to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this phase begins, consider swapping tanks, as the current tank will very likely have the Phase Punch debuff and the off-tank will have a hard time surviving if he has to tank the adds and Algalon together. If you swap once the Black Holes spawn, you'll be given about 45 seconds to defeat Algalon before a forced tank-swap which should be long enough. Players also need to keep alert about Cosmic Smashes as Algalon will still be using this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Algalon reaches 1-2%, he is defeated, all adds and Black Holes despawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;exerpt&quot;&gt;Section 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot;, written by Cicero in 45 BC&lt;/p&gt;

Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.&quot;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
