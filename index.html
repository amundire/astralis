	<h1>Welcome to Astralis</h1>
	<h3>#ToTheStars</h3>
	<p>The theme style was inspired by the Heroes of the Storm <a id="hotsui" href="https://gameuipatterns.com/app/uploads/2017/07/Heroes-of-the-Storm-Main-Menu.jpg">user interface</a>, and a variety of Blizzard artstyles such as the Algalon the Observer bossfight in WotLK.
	The name 'Astralis' is a CS:GO organization.
	The reason I wanted to make something like this is because it looks shiny and eyecatching and I usually used super basic and simple bootstrap themes with 1-2 colors in the Angular6/Reactjs projects.
	Also wanted to impress the pretty lecturer girl. She is best girl.</p>
